            <p class="quote my-2">‘Machine learning is a core, transformative way by which we’re rethinking everything we’re doing. We’re thoughtfully applying it across all our products, be it search, ads, YouTube, or Play. We’re in the early days, but you’ll see us in a systematic way think about how we can apply machine learning to all these areas.’

            <span class="grey"> – Sundar Pichai, CEO, Google</span></p>
            <p class="fsize">The term Machine Learning was coined by Arthur Samuel in 1959, an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence, and stated that “it gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed”. 
                And in 1997, Tom Mitchell gave a “well-posed” mathematical and relational definition that “A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. </p>
                
                <p class="fsize">Machine Learning is the latest buzzword floating around. It deserves to, as it is one of the most interesting subfields of Computer Science. So what does Machine Learning really mean? </p>
                <p class="fsize">
                Let’s try to understand Machine Learning in layman’s terms. Consider you are trying to toss a paper into a dustbin. </p>
                <p class="fsize">
                After the first attempt, you realize that you have put too much force into it. After the second attempt, you realize you are closer to the target but you need to increase your throw angle. What is happening here is basically after every throw we are learning something and improving the end result. We are programmed to learn from our experience. </p>
                <p class="fsize">
                This implies that the tasks in which machine learning is concerned to offer a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing’s proposal in his paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”, in which the question “Can machines think?” is replaced with the question “Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?” 
                Within the field of data analytics, machine learning is used to devise complex models and algorithms that lend themselves to prediction; in commercial use, this is known as predictive analytics. These analytical models allow researchers, data scientists, engineers, and analysts to “produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results” and uncover “hidden insights” through learning from historical relationships and trends in the data set(input). </p>
